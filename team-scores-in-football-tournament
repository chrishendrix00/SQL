/* https://leetcode.com/problems/team-scores-in-football-tournament/

You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:
A team receives three points if they win a match (Score strictly more goals than the opponent team).
A team receives one point if they draw a match (Same number of goals as the opponent team).
A team receives no points if they lose a match (Score less goals than the opponent team).

Write an SQL query that selects the team_id, team_name and num_points of each team in the tournament after all described matches. 
Result table should be ordered by num_points (decreasing order). In case of a tie, order the records by team_id (increasing order).
